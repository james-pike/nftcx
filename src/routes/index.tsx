    <h2>CSS Scroll Driven</h2>
    <p class="p1">
        CSS Scroll Driven refers to a technique where CSS is used to create visual effects or animations that are triggered by the scrolling behavior of the user. It involves manipulating CSS properties based on the scroll position to create dynamic and interactive elements on a webpage.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        1. Parallax scrolling: By adjusting background positions or opacity based on the scroll position.<br/>
        2.Sticky navigation: The navigation bar can have its style modified as the user scrolls, such as changing its background color, size, or position to enhance usability and improve the user experience.
    </p>
    <p class="p3">
        In summary, CSS Scroll Driven involves using CSS and JavaScript to create effects and animations that respond to the user's scrolling behavior. This technique adds interactivity and visual appeal to webpages, making them more engaging for users.
